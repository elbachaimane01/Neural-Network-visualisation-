# Neural-Network-visualisation-
The goal of this assignement is the visualisation of neural networks. This plotting function is based on neural networks with the nnet or neuralnet functions, it also works with numeric weight functions.

The goal of this part is the construction of a function allowing the visualization of neural networks. The choice of this theme is motivated by the usefulness of the visualization of neural networks allowing a deeper understanding of the functioning of these models, the effect of the variation of the internal parameters and the resulting interactions. 

We consider some characteristics of this function: 

+The function can visualize neural networks from the packages neuralnet and nnet but also through a weight matrix. The goal is to build plots even from the realization of neural networks from scratch 

+The function allows to distinguish on the graph between positive and negative weight parameters. It also allows to add the construction of the bias.
